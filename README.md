This repository contains the example code for the [JavaScript Testing Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/javascript-testing-fundamentals) course.


This course is created to introduce you to software testing. More specifically testing your JavaScript code.

In this course, you'll learn how testing will improve your daily life as a developer. We touch base on why testing is important, what you should test and what you do not need to test directly. We introduce you to different types of tests (Unit, Integration and Acceptance tests) and teach you the testing jargon you need to know to start your testing journey.

This course is not only for beginners in testing but also for those who are not sure about what the difference is between Mocks, Spies, and Stubs.

By the end of this course, you'll be equipped with knowledge about testing, jargon, and terminologies and thus be ready to tackle our testing courses.
